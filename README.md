This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Chat_01

Chat_01 is a simple chat application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and React. The app allows users to join room, send messages, and see who's online. The application supports real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client, so any messages you send will appear immediately on all open tabs.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/VadymFES/chat_01.git

2. Install the dependencies:

```npm install```

3. Start the development server:

```npm run dev```

4. Navigate to custom server:

```cd .\server\```

   run it:

```node index.js``` or ```nodemon```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000```

# Usage

Once the development server is running, you can open multiple browsers at ```http://localhost:3000``` and chat with yourself. 

### *Since the project uses local storage to save user names, you cannot chat by opening the project in different tabs in the same browser.*
